Our economic systems were not built for a world driven by technology where prices keep falling. They were built for a pre-technology era when labour and capital were inextricably linked, an era that counted on growth and inflation, an era where we made money from scarcity and inefficiency. That era is over.

Much of the middle class is also feeling squeezed. Instead of technology allowing for a fifteen-hour work week, as Keynes predicted when he penned his 1930s essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” vast numbers of people are working longer, in jobs they rightly fear will soon be gone.

It is easy to point at the wealthy and assign blame, but the focus should instead be on a broken system that reinforces radical inequality. In fact, many of the wealthiest families are aware of the very same risk to society and are intent on trying to fix it, either by entering the debate and making their voices heard and/or committing to philanthropy.

Entire populations are being swayed by politicians who incite more anger and polarization by creating “us versus them” narratives without understanding the root causes of our new reality. Many of them are using social media as a powerful weapon in their aim to consolidate power. They’re building influential communities online that fuel dissension in the streets. In Germany, the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) went from zero seats in the 2013 election to forming the largest opposition party in that parliament in 2019.

Ever-higher-paying jobs are central to this construct. We expect to start our careers, earn more over time, and hopefully at the same time outrun rising prices. If we are lucky enough to have bought assets, the rising prices of those assets, because of inflation, creates longer-term wealth. If we leverage those assets by adding debt, our return is even greater because the asset increases in value while the dollars that we pay back in debt are priced in today’s dollars—and with inflation, and growth in our incomes due to the inflation, we pay back the debt tomorrow in dollars that are worth less.

Deflation, put simply, is when you get more for your money—just as inflation is when you get less for your money. With deflation, a currency becomes more valuable because its buying power goes up in relation to goods and services. With inflation, it’s the opposite: the prices of goods and services go up and therefore a currency’s value is lower as purchasing power is less.

With deflation, a currency becomes more valuable because its buying power goes up in relation to goods and services. With inflation, it’s the opposite: the prices of goods and services go up and therefore a currency’s value is lower as purchasing power is less. Deflation is not intrinsically good or bad. It just matters where you put your money. On each side of the equation, there are winners and losers. With inflation, holders of assets win, since the dollars in the future are worth less and it would therefore take more dollars to buy assets at a later date—like my parents and their first house. With deflation, holders of currency are the winners, since their dollars can buy more goods and services in the future than they could today.

That would allow us to step off the existing treadmill of chasing higher and higher prices, requiring ever-higher-paying jobs to keep up. That may sound radical, but if technology is deflationary, and we expect technology to continue its advance into more and more industries, it may not be radical at all. It may be the only sane thing to do.

But this rise in prices is artificial—driven by an enormous rise in credit and debt. Governments and central banks will do almost anything to stop deflation. Inflation targets, set at typically 2 percent, are public elements of their mandates, with a blend of ever-increasing, wild ideas to keep inflation going. Any real growth that the world has seen is only because of an unprecedented spending spree fuelled by easy credit and debt that masks what is really happening underneath.

There is already too much debt in the world, which paradoxically makes the problem harder to solve. Debt combined with deflation is a toxic combination, because borrowers have to pay the same for their interest payments while earning less. This raises the real value of the debt, making it more unlikely to ever be paid back. Defaults soar and credit is destroyed, leading to severe depressions in economies.

In 2000, the total debt in the world was approximately US$62 trillion. At the same time, the world economy in 2000 was about US$33.5 trillion. Since 2000, the world economy has grown from US$33.5 trillion to about US$80 trillion, but to achieve that growth, the total debt has grown to over US$247 trillion as of the third quarter of 2018, according to the Institute of International Finance. In other words, it has taken approximately $185 trillion of global debt to achieve $46 trillion of global growth.

double that amount of debt to get another $46 trillion of growth. I can’t imagine going to the bank for a loan and pitching this great idea where I would add $4.00 of debt for every $1.00 of growth. Even if I taxed the entire $1.00 gain at 100 percent, the $1.00 would never allow me to pay back my original loan. The mirage of growth today is nothing more than a debt-fuelled spending binge.

A financial system based on credit is just an exchange of money today for money later. I give you dollars today and temporarily lose the utility of my money in exchange for having more later. You have the inverse: the benefit of more money today and less tomorrow as you pay back the loan with interest. This system works on trust—trust that you will pay what you said you would pay. It is the same whether that trust is in a person, company, or government. Remove trust and it affects the credit-worthiness of an individual or company. Remove trust from a system and the entire system can unravel very quickly.

World economies could be viewed as one large economy, driven by trust, interconnection, movement of money, and debt. That means that no single country’s gross domestic product (GDP) can be considered in isolation. There are four components that make up GDP:6 Consumer spending or personal consumption (C) Investments (I) Net exports (X) Government spending (G) The mathematical formula to calculate the components of GDP (Y) is simple: Y = C + I + X + G.

Let’s look at the trade relationship between the United States and China as an example. China runs a trade deficit with the United States, meaning that the United States imports more from China than it exports. Many, including the current president of the US, claim this is unfair. Here is how the balance between the two countries actually works out. Almost 70 percent of the United States’ GDP is made up of consumer spending; in China, consumer spending makes up only about 30 percent of GDP. In China, incentivizing production requires keeping lower wages (relative to the world), tax incentives for production and distribution, and investments in automation to achieve production that allows their exports to win on a world market. Conversely, to support consumer spending at 70 percent of the economy, the United States requires relatively higher wages, high credit creation with low interest rates (debt to finance that increased spending), and lower taxes.

Over ten years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax cuts alone will add an additional $2.28 trillion of national debt to the US.

Understanding this balance and making informed decisions is important because we all live in the same world; each side of a relationship affects the other. A growing consumer class in China could very well help lift world economies, but for that to happen, Chinese workers will need to be paid more. And if American workers want to sell to China, they’ll have to earn less. I’m sure that many people in the US who are frustrated with China’s role as producer would not accept the 996 work weeks (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days per week) for average wages of $1,400 per month that many of their Chinese counterparts have.

As with Germany lending money to Greece, this can be looked at as vendor financing, such as you might get from a car dealer: I provide you cheap capital so that you purchase my goods, and I make more in the long run. It also helps to ensure a US market for China’s exports by keeping interest rates low, so that consumers spend more. But China cannot reasonably stop buying government bonds without collapsing its own economy, because then interest rates would move much higher in the US and cripple consumer spending, which would then collapse China’s economy. It’s a feedback loop in interconnected economies.

If it takes ever-increasing credit growth to achieve economic growth, how are our economies any different from a Ponzi scheme? A Ponzi scheme creates an illusion of profits because it pays early investors with investments from later investors. Even though the scheme is a fraud, it can look like a good business in that early investors talk about how great their returns are. Because it requires more and more capital to pay out investors, it continues until new investors at the bottom of the pyramid slow down enough to stop paying out earlier investors, which brings the entire system down.

To keep the system running, monetary policy all around the world has target inflation rates. From a debt perspective, this makes sense: inflation makes debt easier to pay back because you’re paying yesterday, when dollars cost more, with money from tomorrow, when dollars are worth less. In the United States in 1970, a $3.25 per hour wage had the same purchasing power as a $25.00 per hour job today. A movie ticket that cost $1.55 in 1970 is more than $9.00 today. A gallon of gasoline in 1970 was 36 cents; it’s $2.98 today. A debt that you took on then that cost you 100 hours of work—$325—could be paid off with 13 hours of work today.

Quantitative easing refers to the act of injecting liquidity into an economy by a central bank. In order to inject liquidity, new dollars need to be created and they need to be delivered into the economy. Many people refer to the first part as “printing new money,” though the money does not actually need to be printed—it can just be given as balance sheet credits by a central bank. For instance, the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded from just under $900 billion in 2008 to approximately $4 trillion today.

The second part, delivering the newly created money into the economy, is done in a variety of ways, such as large-scale asset purchases from public and private sectors like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, where the government buys toxic or underperforming assets. By doing so, governments take bad assets off the balance sheets of corporations and give them fresh new capital instead.

Another way to get new money into the system is through directly issuing loans to commercial banks. In the United States in 2008, banks were given access to borrow federal funds at a 0 percent interest rate. The banks could then lend out those dollars at higher interest rates to rebuild their damaged balance sheets over time. Some non-banks at the time, like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, changed their charters to become banks to get access to the free money as well.

By nature, though, quantitative easing also causes currency devaluation, even if that’s not what it’s specifically intended to do. The government doesn’t actually have more assets; it’s just representing its assets with more units of currency, which means each unit of currency is worth less—like cutting a pizza into twelve slices instead of eight, or dividing an estate between ten heirs rather than nine.

An unwind of credit expansion around the world created the Great Depression. To protect American farming jobs from foreign competition, the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, named after the congressmen who conceived it. That act raised tariffs to protect jobs but dramatically underestimated the reaction from other countries in doing so. They were foolish to believe that they could keep their existing exports while protecting their own economy from imports. The resulting trade wars, with Canada and Europe retaliating and increasing tariffs on US goods, are widely understood to have prolonged the Great Depression and made it worse for the very farmers that the tariff act was supposed to protect.

At the end of 2008, there are no bailouts. No quantitative easing. It’s not a difficult thought experiment. Asset prices collapse. Loans on those assets become non-performing.

It’s like we’re living in Bizarro World where everything is backwards. Bizarro—a comic created by Dan Piraro—takes place not on a spherical Earth but on a cube-shaped Htrae (Earth spelled backwards). In one Bizarro strip from April 1961, a salesman is doing a brisk trade selling Bizarro bonds that are “guaranteed to lose money for you.” That’s not even a joke today. In many parts of the world, banks have negative rates: money retains more value stored under your mattress than in a bank.

The pattern of creative destruction and monopoly power stands out when we look at the list of the top companies in the world only ten years ago compared to today. Ten years ago, many of the top companies in the world were started in the late 1800s.

It’s an even bigger issue than it appears. The major platforms control much more than you might be aware of. Because they control the highways and commons of technology, they have asymmetric power over all other types of companies. They are also the ones at the forefront of creating artificial intelligence (AI), which could very well make them the most powerful and important companies to have ever existed.

Strong network effects are at the core of every platform business today. In fact, in a recent three-year study by NFX, network effects accounted for 70 percent of the value in technology companies over the last twenty-three years.12 Network effects are very different from the economies of scale which traditionally drove power. Through economies of scale, the bigger a company was, the more buying power and leverage it had to squeeze out competitors. In contrast, a network effect exists when the value of a product or service gives more value to each user as the number of users increases. A telephone system is a good example: if I am the only one with a phone, the service is useless because I cannot call anyone. With each additional user, the service becomes more valuable to all users, which in turn creates a positive feedback loop of value leading to exponential growth.

Because the platform owners don’t own the supply, they aggregate it, the supply can scale almost indefinitely without the negative impacts of holding that supply. Few buyers realize the vastness of the supply side because they only “see” the top results, and the top results are constantly being tailored for them to drive conversion higher.

Imagine if Google had the same content as the Yellow Pages, or if YouTube had the same content as your local cable station. There would be less value to users, and less reason to go to either. YouTube doesn’t create the vast majority of the content it hosts: it offers a place to aggregate it and therefore all of the cost is in the content providers’ hands to create videos that stand out, while YouTube’s benefit to its users increases as it aggregates more content.

The overall dynamic is why most platforms are monopoly businesses. Early on, the potential results are too impressive for supply to overlook the opportunity. Later, all the buyers are already there so there is almost no choice but to get involved. The network effect of the platform creates a world where the “cost” to suppliers to get buyers’ attention constantly increases but in doing so drives lower cost or higher value to buyers.

On the eve of destruction It is ironic that Schumpeter’s term creative destruction is so widely used in capitalism to celebrate the process of innovation. Schumpeter himself was pessimistic about the long-term sustainability of the process. He saw it as ultimately leading to the undermining of capitalism’s own institutional frameworks. In his own words, “In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse. The capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own.”14

Schumpeter’s view is consistent with that of Nobel laureate Hyman Minsky, but not in the way you might think. Minsky, an American economist, theorized that long periods of financial stability naturally lead to instability because of the rise of debt. The “Minsky moment” is the tipping point where the debt-fuelled asset bubble collapses, assets become difficult to sell at any price, and a market collapse ensues. Interestingly, though, Minsky didn’t forecast a write-down in debt.

In his 1986 book, Stabilizing an Unstable Economy, Minsky wrote, “Every time the Federal Reserve protects a financial instrument, it legitimizes the use of this instrument to finance activity. This means that not only does Federal Reserve action abort an incipient crisis, but it sets the stage for a resumption in the process of increasing indebtedness—and makes possible the introduction of new instruments.”15

As Nassim Nicholas Taleb cleverly points out in his book Antifragile, “Small forest fires periodically cleanse the system of the most flammable material, so this does not have the opportunity to accumulate. Systematically preventing forest fires from taking place ‘to be safe’ makes the big one much worse.”16 By continuing to add debt and kick the can down the road, governments and central banks have prevented some of the small fires—in this case, the pain of restructuring. I realize that calling the 2008 crisis and the monetary easing that allowed the economies of the world to escape restructuring a “small fire” is akin to calling the Great Depression a “recession.”

Let’s look at a couple of examples from our everyday lives: the anchoring effect and the sunk-cost bias. The anchoring effect happens when our minds put too much weight on initial information when making decisions. All subsequent judgments are then made in relation to this anchor. If you need to borrow $1,000 from a friend, it is much easier to first ask for $5,000 and then say that you actually only need $1,000 than it is to ask for $500 and then increase it to $1,000. Even though the final request is the same, the later number is compared against the initial anchor in each case and it feels better when going from the large to the small in this case. This cognitive bias fools us often: in negotiations, where someone sets the initial anchor high, with sale prices, and even in our relationships.

Sunk-cost bias happens when you continue to invest time or money into something because of the time or emotion you have already put in. As Kahneman points out, the potential of losses is a much more powerful motivator than potential for gains. When someone stays in a bad relationship, investment, or job, they are often unknowingly a victim of the sunk-cost bias, keeping in the status quo for fear of change, even though the status quo is something that they do not want.

These are just two of the 150 or so known cognitive biases. Additional biases such as confirmation bias—where we search for information that confirms our perceptions—and bias blind spot—when we recognize a bias in others’ decision-making while failing to see it in ourselves—mean we are often not as clever as we believe. Patterns reinforce themselves and we do not see that we have trapped ourselves in our own boxes. But these boxes are easier to see in others, which leaves a door open for creative destruction.

Campbell’s theory is based on his observation of a common pattern behind the elements of most stories, regardless of their origin. It is found in all mythologies and religions. He calls it “the Hero’s Journey” or “monomyth.” We see it everywhere, and we expect to see it everywhere. It involves a hero who goes on an adventure, faces almost insurmountable obstacles, wins a victory, and then comes home transformed. It has seventeen stages that can be characterized a number of ways but generally follow three main sections: The Departure—Where the hero of the story lives in a normal world and receives a call for adventure. The hero is typically reluctant to follow the call but is then helped by a mentor. The Initiation—Where the hero faces much adversity and ordeal, eventually reaching the main obstacle or central crisis of his adventure. Then in overcoming it, the hero gains an unexpected treasure. The Return—Where the hero returns to the ordinary world where the treasure can be used for the benefit of his community. The hero himself is transformed by the entire adventure as he gains newfound wisdom—which is the unexpected gift.

Fortunately, there are a number of ways. Avid readers and learners, especially those who study across various fields, will tell you that they read diverse topics so they can connect patterns across disciplines or industries. From this practice, they train their brain to recognize opportunity, seeing what worked in one place and applying it elsewhere. By doing so, these people force themselves to break out of the walls that could trap them and to remain open to possibility. Another way of error correcting for these natural biases and stories, according to my friend Bob Sutton, is to argue as if you were right, but listen as if you were wrong. Bob is a Stanford professor and bestselling author of The No Asshole Rule, and for decades he has studied what makes great leaders. The best leaders are constantly learning, curious about where they made mistakes and actively looking for areas where they might have it wrong. Arguing as if you’re right and listening like you’re wrong allows leaders to confidently go forward with a direction, while also being able to course correct when new information arises that suggests a better path.

Most people are generally aware of Moore’s law. Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel, described what we now call Moore’s law in a 1965 article in Electronics magazine. He observed that the number of transistors on a printed circuit board doubled every year and would for at least the next ten years. He later extended that prediction and revised it, saying that doubling would continue every two years. As Moore’s law has progressed over the past fifty years, the actual doubling has occurred approximately every eighteen months. Beyond just the doubling of computing power, we should expect a 21 percent annual decline in price to performance.20 This combination sets up remarkable gains. For example, according to Computerworld magazine, the cost of one megabyte of hard drive memory has fallen from approximately $1 million in 1967 to 2 cents today.

Remember that the underpinnings of the technology revolution are continuing to double. There are developments on the horizon that will make what we have now look primitive. And many of these technologies are not independent. They feed back to each other, which in turn drives more acceleration. For example, the same data captured through visualization in self-driving cars, drones, or robots provides more data to the network to learn faster. If it feels like it’s hard keeping up with the rate of progress today, just wait for what’s to come.

Access changes the requirement for ownership, so autonomous driving is likely to significantly increase the utilization rate of cars. Here’s why: if I can have a car whenever I need it without requiring a driver, I am likely to either 1) decide not to buy a car because I have access to a car whenever needed or 2) if I do buy a car, allow it to be used by others to help me pay for the asset I own. With either choice, utilization rates on cars should move much higher. That means that current forecasts of continually increasing demand for automobiles are very wrong. Instead, automotive production, and the jobs with it, could fall by 50 percent or more as autonomous cars move into the mainstream. Automotive companies, instead of making money through the sale and service of vehicles, will need to adjust their models to remain viable. Most likely that adjustment will have them selling cars as a service option, similar to software-as-a-service models in technology delivery today.

It will also change our cities. Parking in cities is designed for the 5 percent utilization rate, meaning that the amount of parking designed into cities is staggering. According to a 2015 report, 14 percent of land in Los Angeles County is committed to parking.23 You need room for parking while your car is at home as well as at each area that you and your car travel to: school, work, shopping, and so on. All of those parking spaces are often unused but are still required for peak times when needed. When the utilization rate of cars increases from 5 percent, the amount of storage needed to park cars while not in use plummets, which frees up valuable land—which will affect land use and prices, which will affect density, which will feed back on car use... When you remove humans, you also remove human error. Approximately 94 percent of automotive accidents are caused by human error.

Take, for example, a startup in Vancouver called LlamaZOO, which is in a new category of data collection called spatial data that is at the intersection of digital twinning (an exact twin of the physical world that is digital), mixed reality, and business intelligence. By twinning the real world via satellite imagery, drones, and lidar, and adding global positioning, mapping, and other data streams, the company uses mixed reality to reduce the cost of planning and work in the physical world. It allows for remote analyzing of massive amounts of data without traversing faraway sites with people. The company already counts big names such as Teck Resources, Goldcorp, and Chevron as clients. In one case study, LlamaZOO saved more than $55 million annually for a large forest company by interactively surveying regions for individual trees’ heights for harvesting and by analyzing the best design of roads to reduce impact. Those savings come directly from inefficiencies in travel, surveying, and mistakes caused by not seeing the integrated information. And all of those savings are measured in jobs today. For those who have experienced the leading edge of this technology, it feels like something that is hard to “unsee.” By that, I mean that it is difficult to explain how quickly you forget about the headset you are wearing and completely experience a different world, one that feels very real. Having personally spent time in Redmond at the Microsoft HoloLens lab, and walking around on a virtual Mars that won NASA’s software of the year award, I can tell you that travelling to Mars via virtual reality is an experience that is hard to put into words. The software allows collaboration and interaction through virtual avatars. I was sitting about ten feet away at the Code Conference in 2016 when Elon Musk famously discussed the probability of us all living in a simulation. He explained his thesis, which was first introduced by Nick Bostrom, philosopher and author of the book Superintelligence, by using virtual reality/augmented reality as an example. He went on to argue that fidelity in virtual reality is already nearing fidelity of the real world (it feels real) and continuing to advance at a remarkable pace. If it feels real (or almost real) today and is progressing quickly, the chances are quite high that as the technology gets better and we use it more, the lines blur between reality and virtual reality, and we get confused about which reality we are in. Musk went on to ask what the chances are that this is the first time we have created this technology, making the case that if it were not the first time, we would not know it because we were part of a simulation.

Easy credit resulted in a significant rise in prices across asset classes—home prices, oil prices, stock prices, to name a few—creating real wealth for the holders of assets and spurring even more growth, with countless jobs being added to growth sectors of the economy that have been aided by easy credit and low rates. Venture capital and technology companies themselves have benefitted greatly from this cheap source of capital in raising giant venture rounds, meaning that some of the technology progress and feedback loops themselves were quite likely accelerated beyond what would have otherwise been possible. But that boom has now led to another boom, a phase shift where all the rules change. The simple power of technology is that it allows for abundance without the same amount of jobs or income... if we let it. It is a fact that we better get used to if we want that same abundance in our lives.

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed and that the total amount of energy in the universe must remain the same. It can be changed, stored, or moved, but it can’t be created or destroyed. James Prescott Joule (1818–1899) discovered that the transformation of mechanical work (energy) to heat happens in fixed proportions. In his famous experiment, he let a weight of 890 pounds fall one foot on a pulley turning a paddlewheel in water, and he found that the water increased in temperature by one degree. This gave rise to the first mechanical measure of heat, which was energy being transferred but not created or destroyed.

The second law of thermodynamics states that energy always moves from higher to lower concentrations. In other words, heat dissipates. The energy of the sun moves to space. The energy from a boiling pot converts to steam and then into cooler air. Furthermore, all transfer of energy in a closed system creates a more and more disordered state—more entropy. Because each time energy is transformed, some or all of it is wasted as it disperses from higher concentrations to lower ones.

It allowed solar to be used for about $256 per watt. Even with that huge leap forward, $256 per watt was far more expensive than other sources of energy at the time, so it is easy to see why a transition from lower-cost sources of energy to solar power didn’t take place.

One of the greatest criticisms of solar and other renewables is that they are intermittent. The sun doesn’t shine at night, and it can cloud over, meaning that there is too much power at certain times and not enough at others. Combine this with peak load requirements of populations—more energy is required at certain times of the day than others—and storage of that energy becomes an important issue. But along with ongoing innovations in battery technology to reduce this burden, there are other solutions making their way onto the market. One such solution—a flywheel—converts electricity to kinetic energy for storage and then converts kinetic energy back to electricity when needed. There’s a new race to control key pieces of technology to enable a shift to abundant renewable power.

Retail stores, for example, had monopoly power only until the Internet allowed far more choice than a physical store could hold. With power, too, we may see major disruption, and that disruption could come from anywhere. Central utilities or power companies are essentially distribution companies, all about supply and demand, buying energy “supply” for one price and marking it up when selling and distributing it to cover the costs and profit. As solar advances, and price further declines, more consumers will choose to break from the grid in the same way those consumers are “cord cutting” from former cable television monopolies.

Many of the policy tools that worked in the past are likely to work again. But what if AI doesn’t create more jobs in the future? What if it doesn’t just take the ones in the near term but starts to take more and more jobs? The solutions we’re putting in place today expecting a coming job boom could create a more dangerous world.

A brief history of intelligence Our intelligence—our ability to master the world around us—is actually derived from other people: their thoughts, inventions, and science, which we have in turn continued to build upon. Without that information and knowledge, most of our limited time would go into providing basic human needs. Throughout our history, it is our collective growth of knowledge that is the real driver of what we deem “intelligence.”

Your children would know a little less than you, and their children less than them, and so on. In a few short generations, life would be very different, as the inhabitants focused on basic survival needs and rituals designed to enable their most important stories to travel to the next generation. There are real-life examples. The Sentinelese, of North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean, are one of the most isolated tribes in the world; they recently gained unwanted attention when they killed a missionary named John Allen Chau who came to their island. Although they have had contact with outsiders from time to time, in 1956, to protect their way of life, the government of India declared North Sentinel island a tribal reserve. Contact from the outside world is banned. As a small and isolated culture, cut off from the world, they have limited means to build up complex knowledge, and as a result, their way of life has been similar for generations. There are more than 100 isolated tribes of the world today like the Sentinelese, mostly in densely forested areas in South America and Indonesia. The little information that we know about these tribes and their way of life looks very similar to what we know of prehistoric humans from hundreds of thousands of years ago. In fact, for approximately 300,000 years, our brains have remained largely unchanged.41 These isolated and prehistoric people are as we could be—and vice versa.

Besides allowing wide distribution, it also encouraged the criticism and debate of ideas. Religions of the world used the printing press to spread their beliefs, but it also set the stage for science-based reasoning. Authors could share their new ideas and have them tested and confirmed or refuted by others. The ability to do this, over time, developed into the scientific method. Although philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) and Ibn al-Haytham (965–1040 CE) had used similar logic to describe the world around them, the process itself wasn’t generally accepted as such until the late nineteenth century. There is no one inventor of the scientific method. Like science itself, it continued to be refined thanks to the likes of Galileo, Bacon, Descartes, and Newton. The process involves 1) observation, including rigorous skepticism (to counter our cognitive biases); 2) formulating a hypothesis; 3) making a prediction that can be determined to be true or false; and 4) experiments and testing to determine the validity of the hypothesis.

In a world that seems more divisive with each passing day, it is worth remembering that intellectual debate to find better answers is the goal of science and the very thing that has allowed great leaps forward for mankind. To quote Karl Popper again, “True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, it’s the refusal to acquire it.”

has seemed to change overnight on the evolutionary scale. Remember, our brains have been almost the same for around 300,000 years, but we’ve had the printing press for just under 600 years. Just like the exponential effect of pennies doubling or grains of rice on a chessboard, extending our brains to books and refining and extending ideas that came before us allowed our knowledge to increase exponentially.

Try to imagine yourself living in the early to mid-1800s: horse-drawn carriages, no telephones, before the electrification of cities. It is hard to even comprehend that the designs for a modern-day computer could be envisioned then, but Charles Babbage (1791–1871), a British polymath, did just that. Babbage found errors while reviewing astronomical tables that were calculated by hand, and he realized that computational problems were dangerous to navigation. So, he devised a solution and created the first blueprint for a mechanical-based computation. In 1822, Babbage set out to create a “difference engine,” which was strictly a calculator.

another eminent thinker named Claude Shannon (1916–2001) was breaking barriers that enabled many of the advances in computers and artificial intelligence that we now take for granted. Shannon was an American mathematician and one of the main architects of the Information Age. Although not as well known, his breakthroughs rival Albert Einstein’s in that he changed the way we think about information. Shannon was interested in how to transmit information in its simplest form and realized that to do so, information must not be confused with meaning. We rarely hear information in exactly the same way the person sending us the information means it; instead, we attach our own emotion to the information and often change the message as a result.

For Shannon, “These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.”48 He went on to describe how information could be sent using partial messages that give clues to the original message. For example, if a message tells you a number is between 1 and 100, and then the next message tells you the number is odd, you can cut the possibilities in half.

Shannon was also the first to ascribe entropy to communication, and the information in each of these partial messages became a measure for how much uncertainty it resolved for the receiver. By doing so, he invented a unit of measure for information, the bit. In partial messages, one bit of information cuts the number of possibilities in half for the receiver. A message that doesn’t reduce the possibilities for the receiver transmits zero bits of information. Because of Shannon’s information theory, for the first time, information became quantifiable. Measuring information and its growth became as easy as measuring anything else, and information processing, storage, and retrieval were born.

50 If brains learn like computers, then computers can learn like brains. But was Turing right? Do we understand by reducing probabilities? Much work from behavioural science, machine learning, and psychology suggests that the answer is yes, our brains do act like Bayesian probability machines, constantly making new predictions based on changing information from our senses and assigning probabilities to the outcomes.

But in 2016, Google’s DeepMind program AlphaGo beat one of the top players in the world, Lee Sedol, in a match that made history. AlphaGo’s program was based on deep learning, which was “trained” using thousands of human amateur and professional games. It made history not only because it was the first time a computer beat a top Go master, but also because of the way it did so. In game 2 and the thirty-seventh move, the computer made a move that defied logic, placing a black stone in the middle of an open area—away from the other stones. Top players in the world commentating first dismissed the move as a mistake by the AI, but then realized it was no mistake. The move was brilliant, and AlphaGo went on to beat Sedol in the game and win the five-game match 4–1. Later, pundits would say how creative the move was. It was the first time that an AI was ever said to be creative, a domain always thought to be owned solely by humans. Just one year later, in 2017, Google launched a newer version called AlphaGo Zero that beat AlphaGo 100 games to zero.

Not only was that version much more powerful than its predecessor, It also didn’t require any “training” from human games. Understanding only the rules of the game, AlphaGo Zero became its own teacher, playing itself millions of times and through deep reinforcement learning getting stronger with each game. No longer constrained by human knowledge, it took only three days of the computer playing itself to best previous AlphaGo versions developed by top researchers and it continued to improve from there. It mastered the masters, then mastered itself, and kept on going.

How does this relate to our own intelligence? Geoffrey Hinton has long been trying to understand how our brains work. Hinton, the “godfather of deep learning,” is a cognitive psychologist and computer scientist who moved to Canada because of its continued research funding through the second AI winter in the early 1990s. He currently divides his time between his work at Google and as a professor at the University of Toronto. He previously set up the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London with the aim of “building neurobiologically realistic and computationally sound models of the way that the brain computes.”

WHAT MAKES A master? In a landmark 1993 study, Anders Ericsson, Ralf Krampe, and Clemens Tesch-Römer showed that the best violinists and pianists at a German music academy practiced an average of more than 10,000 hours before they turned twenty.52 Malcolm Gladwell later looked at this in his bestseller Outliers, where he researched success in many fields, coming back to the magic number of 10,000 hours. Why were certain people willing to commit to practicing enough to attain mastery? Gladwell found that, in many cases, it was because of a simple human bias. They were better at it early, sometimes only because of when their birthdate fell in the calendar, making them the better part of a year older than other kids in their cohort. Because of their early success, they were reinforced positively, which then made them want to practice more.

Even if the human being could play that many games over the same time period as a computer, another problem exists: how we remember or recall. In a 3,000-person study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, researchers asked participants various questions about the September 11 attacks, from who they were with, to how many planes were involved, to how they felt about the attacks.53 Large inconsistencies emerged from what people reported immediately afterwards versus what they reported later.

Because our senses are constantly bringing in a staggering amount of new information and the storage capacity of our brains is limited, our brains simplify what we store to only the most important parts. If information seems to match our own mental model, we encode it that way. In simplifying, some vivid details are lost or melded with other memories to create something that might not be entirely accurate. That storage uses our own filters of past experiences to remember things that look similar to what the brain associates with the new memories.

As artificial intelligence moves across industries, the gains to humanity are incredible. But as each new skill is acquired by artificial intelligence, jobs are at risk since AI will do them better at a drastically different price. With each new skill learned by computers, more knowledge is added to the knowledge graph of the world and that skill can be applied anywhere at almost no cost. That creates an even faster rate of innovation where artificial intelligence becomes superior to human intelligence across all fields.

How different? Take your genome by way of example. The entire human genome—our complete set of DNA—was sequenced for the first time in 2003. It contains approximately three billion base pairs of two of four possible chemical units; they reside in the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes within the nucleus of all our cells. Each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of genes, which carry the instructions for making proteins. You could think of your genome as an instruction booklet for how to make and operate a human. But it’s an enormous instruction booklet, one you could never fully understand because of its complexity. There are more possible combinations, and interactions between combinations, than a human mind can understand, and that complexity is only magnified by other inputs like exercise, environment, food, and drugs we take. It’s like the game of Go: how many of the “moves” do we and our health practitioners not see because we are only capable of seeing a small portion of the overall “moves” and reinforcing the patterns we have learned?

But it’s not just about increases in compute power. We are at an inflection point where it is about gathering the right data in data sets that can be analyzed by machines and then helping train those data sets. All of today’s top companies globally are data companies that enjoy network effects, capturing more data as they grow, which in turn creates better systems. They are creating data monopolies where vast data sets are being combined to produce impressive results. The more data, and the more data velocity, the better the artificial intelligence becomes and the better outcomes from it.

The system works as follows: all of China’s population receives a score that is available as public record. Points are deducted for things like traffic violations, bad debt, or selling faulty products, and points are added for giving to charity, giving blood, or other good deeds. The idea behind the original plan might not seem bad at a high level; it was targeting dishonesty in government affairs and encouraging commercial and social integrity. But it is easy to see where such a system could be open to error and manipulation. The rules of the systems are not universal, and the systems are not interconnected. In some regions, listening to music too loudly deducts points; in others, jaywalking or playing video games does. It would be hard to imagine any system in China that rewarded opposition in any form to the Communist Party. The system is already functioning in twelve regions and is set to roll out countrywide in 2020. By the end of 2018 in the twelve regions, the system had already blocked access for 5.4 million people from travelling on high speed trains and an additional 17 million people from taking airline flights.

The Huawei case, where the United States government charged China’s Huawei and its officers of intellectual property theft as well as sanctions violations, offers clues to that race. It is no secret that Huawei has ambitions to build an infrastructure backbone to capture data flows. Its own tagline, “Building a fully connected, intelligent world,” captures it succinctly. Powering much of the 5G network that will allow faster communications would give any company, including Huawei, a tremendous advantage in data capture. The real revolution of 5G is not only the twenty times speed advantage over 4G networks prevalent today but the amount of data that can be transmitted through the increased bandwidth.

I’ve been lucky enough to spend some time talking over beers with Ben and I share this view about the downside of having any corporation or government with as much control over something that will become so powerful. So do many others, including Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman, who helped kick off the OpenAI initiative. OpenAI’s mission is to “build safe AGI and ensure AGI’s benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.” But although these open initiatives are laudable, what hurts many of them is the lack of data and data velocity, which inhibits the learning rate. Core to every one of the major platforms is a product or service that compels you to give them your data for free—from your Google searches, to your Alexa enquiries, to your Instagram pictures. The platform then monetizes your data in numerous ways, selling products or services more effectively to you or selling your data to advertisers. All the while the platform is using its tremendous data advantage to make its service better and better.

This also leads to a logical next step in our own evolution. I, for one, do not worry about artificial intelligence taking over the world one day. It is not that there aren’t risks along the way from misuse or misunderstanding of the new intelligence superpowers. Those risks include some laid out already—like a single country or company dominating artificial intelligence that leaves few people controlling a vast power and the rest of humanity as pawns to that power. But a higher probability is that we extend our brains. Just as books were an extension of our minds that gave us tremendous rise in “intelligence” and the ability to better master our world, the next logical step might be the integration of mind and machine. Research is quickly expanding on brain–computer interfaces, and many people would readily choose a path that would exponentially increase their own “intelligence.” As Elon Musk recently said about robots, “If you can’t beat them, join them.”

But whether we embrace it or not, the genie will not be put back in the bottle. These things are true: 1) error correction is at the heart of all of our “intelligence”; 2) information is growing at an exponential pace; 3) that information is being transferred to computers that can gain knowledge and correct errors faster than human brains can; and 4) Every one of our jobs is a function of our intelligence.

To Alex, life was amazing. And then, as he told me, “That changed almost overnight.” Religion was used to divide. Him from his friends, his friends from him. At the outset of the war in 1992, Alex’s family believed that if they didn’t take sides and stayed in their home, they would be safe. In an instant, Alex was living on the wrong side of a border, trapped one day in his home with his family on the other side of the frontier. Attempting to leave risked being shot from both sides: from one because you were trying to escape, and from the other because you were mistaken for an attacker. The people who controlled his area would come in and search homes, randomly taking people to torture or kill them while stealing all their valuables. Alex’s grandparents lived eighteen kilometres from the city and he watched their entire village burn one evening from his upper floor window.

Alex was one of the lucky ones. The first and last UN convoy evacuated him along with some other children six months later. He lived in a refugee camp for more than three of the next years—“a war zone of its own.” Not welcome in his birth country, he was finally granted asylum in Canada after many applications. He did not have any communication with his parents, grandparents, or the rest of his family for years. His parents lived through that time thanks to various people who hid them from the authorities. Eventually his mom was allowed a day reprieve because the authorities figured that, with a husband on the other side, she would return. With the rest of his family safe, Alex’s father made his own daring escape during a late-night run across the border.

The lack of an ability to form bonds is associated with some of the most severe personality disorders, such as paranoia and schizophrenia, and much research has been done on the need for humans to belong. In a 1995 research paper, Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary maintain that there is an almost universal need for humans to bond, and that it has a major impact on happiness and on social, emotional, and physical well-being. “The need to belong is a powerful, fundamental, and extremely pervasive motivation,” they write, and they discuss the possibility that “much of what human beings do is done in the service of belongingness.”

Belonging to one group most likely also means not belonging to another group. As a consequence, a natural by-product of deepening some relationships is not deepening others—or worse. This can create “us versus them,” and it is a far more powerful force in your life than you may realize.

In a famous set of social psychology experiments done in the 1950s through early 1960s, Muzafer Sherif (1906–1988) focused on intergroup conflict and resolution between eleven- and twelve-year-old white protestant boys of similar social economic upbringing. The experiment was called the Robbers Cave experiment. None of the boys knew that they were participants in a study. Sherif set out by randomly assigning the boys to one of two groups and put them in different parts of a camp so they could each create a common group identity. Each group named itself—for example, the Eagles and the Rattlers—and made flags celebrating the individuality of their own groups. Once group identity was established, Sherif went on to the next phase of the experiment by setting up competition for scarce resources, in this case pocket knives and other prizes that the boys highly valued, with no prizes given to the losers. This part of the experiment lasted between four and six days and set the stage for conflict between the groups. Over the course of competition, the groups became increasingly hostile to each other. What started as good sportsmanship escalated to quickly to name calling, cheating, raiding of cabins, and fistfights. Some of the boys carried around rocks in their socks as protection in case they were ambushed by the other team. As Sherif noted in his 1966 book Group Conflict and Co-operation, competition generally led to “us versus them” group identities. Through this experiment, boys with no behavioural issues were turned into hostile, narrow-minded opponents.60

As Sherif noted in his 1966 book Group Conflict and Co-operation, competition generally led to “us versus them” group identities. Through this experiment, boys with no behavioural issues were turned into hostile, narrow-minded opponents.60 For the purpose of this book, the most important part of Sherif’s research was in phases three and four of the experiments: once they were locked into their respective groups, Sherif attempted to bring them together. In phase three, he brought the groups together for limited times to watch movies and eat together. He hypothesized that contact alone would not have any marked decrease in the tension between groups. This was confirmed in all contact sessions, with teams either sitting separately, calling names, or in one case having a food fight at dinner. In phase four of the experiment, Sherif introduced superordinate goals—higher-level goals where he believed that groups would come together to solve bigger problems and move beyond their differences. The first of these superordinate goals was the drinking water problem. In orientation, the researchers told both groups that occasionally vandals broke their only reservoir of water, so they should make sure to fill up their canteens each day. In phase four, the researchers created a problem by damaging the main source of water and announcing a water emergency to both groups that required immediate help. Both groups volunteered to help with a common goal of securing water. The water tank was located just over a mile from the camp, and after searching for damage across the entire line, the boys congregated at the tank. They found the tank three-quarters full of water and eventually found that the problem was at the valve, eventually fixing the water and saving the day. With each subsequent superordinate goal—where the groups had to work together to solve problems—the groups became closer to each other, eventually forming close relationships. As a defining moment of bringing the boys back together, on the bus ride home—just before a refreshment stop—one of the Rattlers noted that each member of their team was still owed their $5 prize for winning the beanbag toss from earlier at camp. The Rattlers, instead of spending it on themselves alone, suggested that they buy malted milks for all of the boys in both groups.

In 1943, American psychologist Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) proposed a theory that all humans possess a hierarchy of needs from basic need to self-actualization: some needs were more important than others, and needs on one level must be satisfied before the next can be addressed.62 As an example, survival is a basic need and, as a result, is the first thing that motivates our behaviour. If you are starving, it is difficult to think about other needs.

One of the early criticisms of Maslow’s pyramid was that there was not enough scientific rigour to back it up. In 2011, Louis Tay and Ed Diener released a study to test his theory. According to Tay and Diener, “The findings suggest that Maslow’s theory is largely correct. In cultures all over the world the fulfillment of his proposed needs correlates with happiness.”63

Understanding needs and desires and then targeting them is at the heart of persuasion, so it’s no surprise that this early work by Maslow helped propel marketing and communications in countless industries and brands. It’s not the only psychological insight that has. The work of researchers at the front lines of behaviour science is underlying most of our products and services. Advertising and marketing deliberately play on our desires and biases to guide our thoughts.

In his seminal book Actionable Gamification, Yu-kai Chou proposes a framework called Octalysis. In that framework, Yu-kai believes that there are eight motivational forces that drive every action we take—not just in games, but foundational to everything. He believes that they can be built into a framework that can be used to massively influence us because our brains are hardwired to accept these motivational forces: Epic Meaning and Calling—The idea that you are doing something greater than yourself or the belief that you were chosen to do something. Development and Accomplishment—The internal drive of making progress, developing skills, and eventually overcoming meaningful challenges. Creativity and Feedback—When you are engaged in a creative process where you have to repeatedly figure things out and try different combinations of actions to progress. Ownership and Possession—The feeling of owning something: wealth, properties, data, collectables... Social Pressure and Relatedness—All the social elements that drive people, including mentorship, acceptance, social responses, companionship, as well as competition and envy. Scarcity and Impatience—Wanting something because you can’t have it, because the resource is scarce or because you are prevented from accessing it. Unpredictability and Curiosity—Wanting to find out what will happen next—such as when watching a movie or while gambling. Loss and Avoidance—The avoidance of something negative happening.64

What mechanisms in game design create habits and keep us coming back? For example, if a game is too difficult to win early, users get frustrated and do not stick with it, so game designers include early wins or prizes to create dopamine responses in your brains, which create stickiness. As the game progresses, if it is too easy to win or collect prizes, users quickly get bored and drop off. Over time, by increasing the difficulty in combination with giving ownership of prizes that can be used to get through harder levels, game designers create a ladder of motivators to keep your brain engaged.

The conjunction of those three things—1) Maslow’s hierarchy, where many in the world or even our own backyard are at very different stages of the pyramid; 2) technology that targets us individually and therefore reinforces belief patterns; and 3) a natural tendency in humans to create “us versus them”—has the potential to create a dangerous reinforcing loop where hate and division reign.

One US dollar in 1914 was equal to 4 German marks; by 1923, the same US dollar was worth 4.2 trillion German marks. Imagine a life’s savings not being enough to purchase a loaf of bread. As leader of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, or Nazi Party, Hitler used this growing frustration to build a strong following. He made a failed early attempt at revolution with his Munich Beer Hall Putsch and was imprisoned in 1923; while imprisoned, in an effort to continue his “us versus them” narrative, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf (My Struggle), originally titled Four and a Half Years (of Struggle) against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice.

In 1924, together with the Dawes Plan, in which US banks lent against German institutional assets, a new currency was established that brought some stability back to the German economy and, with it, stability in government. But in 1929, the US financial collapse and subsequent depression caused the US banks to call their loans to Germany. Unable to pay the loans, Germany again faced massive unemployment and instability, which Hitler used to build party membership quickly. The Nazi Party received 19 percent of the vote in 1930 and from there continued to consolidate power through propaganda until 1933, when the Enabling Act gave Hitler ultimate power and dictatorship, which he used to systematically kill an estimated six million Jews and eleven million others in concentration camps in his pursuit of an Aryan race. A master race against all others. Us versus them taken to the extreme.

He further reasoned that “propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and, in so far as it is favourable to the other side, present it according to the theoretical rules of justice; yet it must present only that aspect of the truth which is favourable to its own side.”65 As we look back at one of the black scars on the history of humanity, it is worth considering that many of the people Hitler persuaded into following him were, in his own words, a vacillating crowd of human children. It is also worth considering leadership today and to what extent we might be being manipulated. A famous Yale study on social psychology, conducted by psychologist Stanley Milgram (1933–1984) in the 1960s, attempted to measure our obedience to authority figures.66 Milgram originally designed the experiment to try to answer the question, “Could the millions of accomplices to genocide in the concentration camps be just following orders?” His experiments showed that what we think we will do is different from what we actually will do.

Due to this, in a game where everyone cooperates, very often, an incentive accrues to the person who “betrays” or “cheats.” In other words, cheating seems like the right payoff, as long as you’re the only one and you don’t get caught. From the relatively innocuous to the more dangerous, this applies to many areas of your life. Let’s look at a number of examples from the real world to see how it plays out.

Military spending. If no country spent money on weapons—nuclear or otherwise—that money could instead be used to benefit the greater society. But if one country chooses to spend on its military and others do not, then that country gains an advantage in military superiority. That creates risk, either perceived or real, for any country not investing in its military. This in turn forces other countries to spend on military to gain parity or create a deterrent to attack, especially if a deemed superior power signals its intent to invade.

Playing out the strategies against each other through computers, you can also determine which strategies are more effective than others. For example, tit for tat is a fairly simple strategy where one cooperates in the beginning and then copies the move of its competitor. By doing so, it seeks cooperation and continues to cooperate until a competitor does otherwise. If a competitor chooses to betray at some point down the road, it also betrays, only cooperating again if the competitor cooperates first, which is similar to forgiveness in our own lives. This strategy seemed to win against most other strategies. Survival, it seems, at least in a computer simulation, is enhanced by cooperation.

A simple thought experiment shows why. Consider an imaginary world where there was no conflict. Humanity had agreed through mutual reciprocity, trust, and cooperation to abolish all wars. In that imaginary world, society would rid itself of death and destruction from conflict. The prize for all inhabitants would be a world of peace and love. Weapons and the cost of those weapons would no longer be needed. But if a world like that existed, the prize to the power hungry for betrayal would be much higher: a case would be where one country secretly amasses weapons to easily invade and take over all countries because those inhabitants would be unable to defend themselves. And because of that increased payoff, betrayal becomes more likely.

With abundance comes price deflation. This is simple supply-and-demand economics: the more abundant something is, the more likely it is that its price falls. Abundance changes our perception and economic theory so much that sometimes we do not even recognize something’s value anymore, especially when that abundance can be created for free or almost free. Take oxygen. Without it, we stop breathing and die. By that fact alone, it is probably the most valuable thing in our lives. But it is also abundant, making up about 21 percent of the atmosphere, and because it is so abundant, it is free. It would be hard to imagine any business coming up with a very successful model that charged us for the air we breathe (unless, that is, we pollute our world and clean air becomes scarce).

In a world where technology is concurrently driving deflation and abundance, maybe eventually, one of the forcing functions that makes cooperation more likely to stick is the very fact that there will not be a large economic incentive to “cheat” or “betray”—abundance minimizes the payoff. Or maybe we should attempt to create an economic system that works that way.

It is not that there isn’t conversation. All over the world, measures are being explored to try to deal with the problem of rising inequality. But the solutions proposed so far only serve to drive further division, because they fail to recognize the primary reason for that rise in inequality. Economic dogma gives us a false choice from frameworks built for a time before technology, when the world operated differently. Not seeing any other option, we lock into one economic framework or another and defend our position at all costs. And as positions becomes entrenched, we become blind to potential solutions that could save us, just like Kodak missing the digital camera.

I thought of all of the examples of companies current and past who couldn’t or didn’t make the transition. The average thirty-three-year tenure of companies on the S&P 500 list is forecasted to shrink to just twelve years by 2027 due to technology. It makes sense—transition requires long-term thinking. It requires going against the grain of where the current market and profits are. Bets on the future are invariably big bets against where the market is today.

Information growth and the rate of change will only accelerate from here, and in a world that is changing so fast, it is not reasonable to expect those in government to be any less vulnerable than we are—even if they set the rules.

Remember that, according to Ray Dalio, there are only four levers governments can pull to escape debt crises. The current debt burden is so large that any long-term solution must deal with it, so we will categorize the proposed solutions by how they attempt to use one of the four ways to escape the debt burden: Austerity—spending less Debt defaults/restructuring The central bank printing money or other guarantees Transfers of money from those who have more than they need to those who have less (much higher taxes for the rich) There has been very little mention of the first two levers. As we covered in chapter 1, because of deflation, austerity would create a vicious feedback cycle and a collapse in asset prices, combined with lower employment that would result in debt defaults or restructuring. Because of that, austerity (lever 1) and debt defaults and restructuring (lever 2) are inextricably linked. Whether we start with restructuring or austerity is immaterial; debt will need to be restructured. It is also the most painful for society to bear in the short term, so that might be why there is virtually no dialogue on either of these solutions.

The greatest irony of this camp is that it has the highest belief in a free-market economy and capitalism but at the same time doesn’t realize that free-market capitalism is not what is happening today. Many of the current policies around the world could be categorized here, along with many other proposals on the table. When you hear about central bank easing or stimulus, think of this camp. Negative interest rates, modern monetary policy, printing money and driving it into hands of spenders, national and local tax cuts to increase spending—it doesn’t matter what you name it or what form it takes, all of these solutions keep the party going by driving more debt.

A day will come, probably sooner than later, when we realize that the only thing driving our economies is the explosion of debt. If governments need to run huge deficits with extremely low interest rates for fear of growth failing, even in economies that are running at near full employment, imagine how the debt and deficits explode in a recession or depression when the economy falters. Once bond holders determine that governments have little ability to repay or service the debt, the risk premium (or interest rates) on the debt will rise. Sure, governments can monetize and make their currencies worthless, but as other central banks monetize as well, the strategy itself becomes irrelevant.

This line of thinking in politics is the liberal/socialist/communist camp. It goes by the principle that the system should be fair for the disadvantaged, so we must tax the wealthy more to pay for the services to the poor. All of the solutions in this bucket require wealth transfers and, because of that, they are deeply unpopular to many of those with wealth. It is hard to see the money that you believe that you have earned because of your ingenuity or hard work go to others who you deem not to have worked as hard. The argument from those who have wealth is that the higher the tax rate on the wealthy, the more disincentive there is to take risks, innovate, and be a strong contributor to society. One of the more prominent proposals in this camp is universal basic income. In policy circles around the world, it is getting serious airtime. The idea is simple in premise: raise taxes on the wealthy to give a minimum basic income whether people work or not, topping people up if they work to a maximum amount but also not requiring them to work for their wage.

On execution, it becomes much more difficult. Universal basic income is essentially a version of wealth transfer. Beyond the traditional arguments from the right that it disincentivizes work and, as a result, incentivizes people to get paid for nothing, there is a cornucopia of additional challenges because of the complexity in determining the right wage.

How would government differentiate wages by needs—choosing to live in one city versus another, for example, because of varying costs of living? What if someone chose to live in an expensive city because the opportunities for jobs were higher there but still couldn’t find a job—would the basic income be higher for that person?

The most important problem with the solution, though, is simply this: it does not deal with the root cause. Deflation is being caused by technology and, because of that, it will ride the same exponential wave that technology does. That means that the rate of deflation (without printing more money) will only accelerate from here. The abundance that technology provides us doesn’t require net new jobs around the world. It obliterates the work and the jobs we already have. That negative effect on jobs will accelerate globally. By cementing in a dual class society, we only ignore the underlying structural change that caused it in the first place. Ignoring that underlying reason is likely to create even more division.

Both of the above solutions don’t consider that since global debt is already so high and expanding quickly, a reset of debt is needed in any truly viable solution. That reset will likely be painful and could erase vast fortunes overnight while also creating new ones. Similar resets have happened in the past. There will be winners and losers depending on where bets are placed.

Just as game theory predicts, we care about our own needs first. Domestic issues always take precedent over international ones, which means a system that is controlled by one nation and is the backbone of all other currencies might work for a time—until the country’s domestic issues force it to unilaterally deliver economic benefit to the nation in control of the currency while hurting all others.

A key construct of Bretton Woods was an agreed-upon international monetary system where all countries tied exchange rates to the price of gold and the US dollar; the US dollar became the primary currency of the world and the US dollar was tied to gold through a fixed exchange rate.

The new rules established trust in an international framework that allowed global trade to expand and increased global prosperity because it meant that countries could not artificially manipulate their currencies at will. Again, as game theory predicts, the agreement showed that when countries work together with a clear understanding of the rules, prosperity was enhanced for all. But in 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated a critical aspect of the system—the conversion of the US dollar to gold—and with that change created a system where the US dollar, a fiat currency subject to domestic agenda, was the backbone of the world’s economic order.

It also enabled a single country to change the rules by printing more currency, and therefore set the stage to return to where we are now, where each country manipulates its currency for political gain while worsening a framework for fair trade.

There is a principle in philosophy called Occam’s razor: a simpler solution is more likely to be correct than a complex one. It makes intuitive sense. Complexity makes us prone to error. As the number of assumptions in coming up with a hypothesis increases, the chances increase that one or more of those assumptions are wrong. To that end, I am going to propose what might be considered the simplest solution of all. So simple, in fact, that it will be hard to imagine.

Consider this alternative: allowing abundance without the jobs might actually open an entirely new enlightenment era where we have time to enjoy the benefits that technology brings. A true capitalist system could work well in that environment because there would still be an incentive to work harder and innovate. Prices of all things would fall, yes, but those creating value would be paid for their value creation—at a rate that matched the new realities of supply and demand and our digital world.

The digital and distributed nature of Bitcoin allows it to benefit from a network effect (which was discussed in chapter 2) with each additional user enhancing its value. As more users trust the system, more trust accretes to the system. Although it is hard to imagine it surpassing any of the main currencies, that reality could easily change tomorrow as more currencies come under pressure; the by-product of that pressure increases the value of Bitcoin or Bitcoin type of network. In other words, what starts as a way for citizens in Venezuela and other regions of the world to escape crushing currency devaluation could jump from country to country and easily build to a point where it becomes the de facto standard of trust.

Asking big questions is sometimes more powerful than the solution itself because it inspires knowledge of the world to solve it and, as such, brings diverse ways of solving problems. An example of asking a big question is the Ansari X Prize, launched in 1996 by Peter Diamandis, in which twenty-six teams from all over the world competed for a prize of $10 million to create a private spacecraft that was capable of carrying three passengers into sub-orbital space two times within two weeks. Those teams spent more than $100 million, developed breakthroughs, and launched a new space race which we are seeing the benefits of today. Since that time, other crowdsourced competitions have been used to develop breakthroughs in everything from healthcare, to creating better algorithms to find dark matter, to cleaning our oceans. One of the key attributes of crowdsourcing is that it is open to participation; it allows ideas and contribution to come from anywhere and anyone. Those solutions are often far better than anything that could have been imagined by experts in a field.
